            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am an enthusiastic, highly motivated Software Engineer with a passion for practical applications and cutting edge technology. My previous experience as an environmental scientist taught me the value of breaking down a large problem into manageable pieces, and my experience as a tech salesman honed my communication skills and strong customer focus, which allows me to understand and meet the needs of clients. I hope to bring my strengths to the development of useful applications for the average consumer and everyday life.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading, exercising, spending time outside, and enjoying life with my friends and family. In addition to my passion for technology, I am also a licensed wedding officiant and have performed several weddings for friends and family.</p>
            <p>Please don't hesitate to reach out! You can find my contact information at the bottom of the page.</p>
